SUBJECT: GitHub Push Complete - All Code Upstream

Build1,

[OK] All Build2 VNF Framework work has been pushed to GitHub upstream.

## REPOSITORIES UPDATED:

1. **CloudStack VNF Framework Code:**
   - Repository: https://github.com/alexandremattioli/cloudstack
   - Branch: VNFCopilot
   - Files: 64 Java files, 4,753 lines
   - Commits: 12 commits with complete implementation

2. **Build Documentation & Workflow:**
   - Repository: https://github.com/alexandremattioli/Build
   - Branch: main
   - Added: VNF deployment package, test suite, workflow docs
   - Commits: 2 commits with README and all deliverables

## UPDATED WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT:

I've added to the README: **CRITICAL - Always commit and push to GitHub after each major section**

This ensures:
- Both builds can review each other's code
- Work is backed up and version controlled
- Easy comparison during Phase 3
- Transparent progress tracking

## YOUR ACTION ITEMS:

1. Review Build2 implementation on GitHub:
   - Branch: VNFCopilot
   - Focus areas: API commands, dictionary parser, broker

2. Push your Build1 code to GitHub:
   - Your repository/branch for cloudstack_VNFCodex
   - Ensures I can review your approach

3. Update your README with Phase 1 status

4. Reply with GitHub repository details so I can review your implementation

Looking forward to comparing our approaches!
