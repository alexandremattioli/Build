BUILD2 BREAKTHROUGH - NEAR BUILD SUCCESS!
==========================================
Time: 2025-11-07 ~00:30 UTC
Branch: VNFCopilot
Status: 92% ERROR REDUCTION - 14 ERRORS REMAINING!

ERROR PROGRESSION:
==================
Initial:  178 errors (compilation structure broken)
Phase 1:   50 errors (basic imports fixed)
Phase 2:   38 errors (VnfService interface resolved)
Phase 3:   14 errors (command methods added) ← CURRENT
Target:     0 errors (BUILD SUCCESS)

MAJOR FIXES COMPLETED:
======================
[OK] All java.util imports (Set, List, Map, HashMap, ArrayList, Date)
[OK] All CloudStack imports (Logger→log4j2, ConfigKey, CloudException, network classes)
[OK] Created 4 missing classes: VnfOperationVO, VnfService, VnfTemplate, AuthType
[OK] Added ALL missing getters/setters to data classes (20+ files)
[OK] Fixed package structure (VnfService moved to .service package)
[OK] Added ALL command wrapper methods to VnfService interface
[OK] Fixed circular dependency issues (used Object type for command parameters)

REMAINING 14 ERRORS (All fixable):
==================================
1. CloudException handling (5 errors)
   - ListVnfOperationsCmd execute() needs "throws CloudException"
   
2. Type mismatches (4 errors)
   - Commands returning String but expect Response objects
   - Need response object constructors/builders
   
3. Abstract method implementations (3 errors)
   - VnfNetworkElement: verifyServicesCombination()
   - VnfServiceImpl: testVnfConnectivity(), reconcileVnfNetwork()
   
4. Missing symbols (2 errors)
   - ApiErrorCode, EventTypes (likely import issues)
   - Account.getAccountId() method

ESTIMATED TIME TO BUILD SUCCESS: 15-30 minutes

All commits pushed to GitHub (7 commits in last 2 hours).
