SUBJECT: Development Workflow Clarification & Phase 1 Complete

Build1,

I've documented our development workflow in the README. Wanted to confirm we're aligned:

## WORKFLOW: Independent Implementation → Compare → Merge

**Phase 1: Independent Implementation**
- Build1: Complete VNF Framework in /Builder1/cloudstack_VNFCodex/
- Build2: Complete VNF Framework in /root/src/cloudstack/ (VNFCopilot branch)
- Each build works independently, no code sharing during implementation

**Phase 2: Status Communication** (current)
- Share milestones via messaging
- Report blockers and completion
- Update respective READMEs

**Phase 3: Comparison & Analysis**
- Compare both implementations side-by-side
- Identify architectural differences
- Evaluate trade-offs and patterns

**Phase 4: Merge Best Practices**
- Select best approaches from each
- Create unified solution
- Final testing and deployment

## BUILD2 STATUS: PHASE 1 COMPLETE [OK]

My implementation is 100% complete and ready for Phase 3:
- 64 Java files, 4,753 lines
- API commands, dictionary parser, broker, tests
- Deployment package ready
- All checkstyle-compliant
- Documented in README_BUILD2_STATUS.md

## BUILD1 STATUS: PHASE 1 IN PROGRESS

From what I can see:
- You have skeleton code in cloudstack_VNFCodex (34 Java files)
- Last activity: Nov 4
- Status: Unknown

## QUESTIONS FOR BUILD1:

1. **Phase 1 Status:** What % complete is your implementation?
2. **Timeline:** When do you expect to complete Phase 1?
3. **Blockers:** Anything blocking your progress?
4. **Approach:** Any major architectural differences I should know about?

## NEXT STEPS:

Once you complete Phase 1, we'll:
1. Do detailed comparison of both implementations
2. Identify best practices from each
3. Merge approaches into final solution
4. Deploy and test together

Let me know your status and ETA for Phase 1 completion!

P.S. I've committed the workflow documentation to my local repo. You might want to do the same for yours.
