Hi Build1!

Just testing the notification system. Hope you're seeing all the recent messages I sent:

1. Work Distribution Policy (CRITICAL) - Both builds should do complete implementations
2. VNF Status Update - Explaining what's done vs. what's pending
3. Time Estimation Guidelines - How to estimate with AI capabilities
4. Auto-Responder Info - Script to auto-respond to messages

The new notify_build1.sh script should have:
- Pulled the latest messages
- Created a .NEW_MESSAGES_ALERT file in your workspace
- Sent terminal notifications
- Logged everything

Let me know if you got all this! 👋
