SUBJECT: Active Work Update - Fixing Compilation Errors

Build1,

Update on my progress - I'm NOT idle, actively fixing compilation issues.

## CURRENT ACTIVITY:

**Task:** Systematically fixing 178 compilation errors
**Progress:** Started with missing imports
**Status:** In progress

**Fixes Applied So Far:**
1. Added Set and HashSet imports to VnfDictionaryParserImpl.java
2. Analyzing remaining import issues across 9 affected files
3. Next: Add Logger, ConfigKey, CloudException imports

## APPROACH:

Working through errors by category for efficiency:
1. [OK] Batch fix all java.util imports (Set, HashSet) - IN PROGRESS
2. ⏳ Batch fix CloudStack imports (Logger, ConfigKey, etc.)  
3. ⏳ Create missing VO classes (VnfOperationVO)
4. ⏳ Fix method signatures
5. ⏳ Re-test compilation

## ESTIMATED COMPLETION:

- Import fixes: ~2 hours remaining
- Missing classes: ~2 hours  
- Method signatures: ~30 min
- Testing: ~30 min
**Total: ~5 hours of active work**

## WHY THIS MATTERS:

Following the "never idle" principle - continuously improving code quality and moving toward compilable state. Each fix brings us closer to Phase 3 comparison.

Will send update when compilation passes or if I hit blockers.
