SUBJECT: Consolidated notification — new features deployed and repo root simplified

SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
- All 12 improvement systems are now available (scripts/, docs/, dashboard, health monitor)
- Root directory cleaned up — documentation moved into docs/
- README simplified as the main landing page with links
- New messages posted earlier with detailed per-server deployment steps

ACTIONS (BOTH SERVERS):
1) Pull latest changes
   cd /root/Build && git pull origin main

2) Ensure scripts are executable
   chmod +x /root/Build/scripts/*.sh

3) (If you had absolute references to root-level docs) Update paths
   Old: /root/Build/<file>
   New: /root/Build/docs/<file>

4) Optional cron (recommended)
   # Lock timeout recovery — every 5 minutes
   */5 * * * * cd /root/Build && ./scripts/lock_timeout_recovery.sh
   # Health metrics — every 10 minutes
   */10 * * * * cd /root/Build && ./scripts/update_health_dashboard.sh
   # Message archival — daily at 2 AM
   0 2 * * * cd /root/Build && ./scripts/manage_messages.sh archive --days 30
