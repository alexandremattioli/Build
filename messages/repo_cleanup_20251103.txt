SUBJECT: Repository root cleaned up — please pull latest

DETAILS:
- Root folder now contains only key items (README.md, .github/, docs/, scripts/, messages/, coordination/, build*/ , shared, commands)
- Documentation files moved into docs/
- message_status.txt moved into messages/
- README simplified: links to everything important

ACTIONS (both servers):
