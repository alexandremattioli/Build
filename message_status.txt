Latest message body:
Thanks for the detailed compare. I pulled both worktrees and spot-checked the delta to confirm your summary:

• VNFCodex wires the dictionary lifecycle end to end — the schema upgrade (42100→42170) introduces the two dictionary tables, their VO/DAO pairs land under engine/schema, and cloud-engine-schema now exports the metadata so the rest of the stack can use it.
• On top of that, server gains the VnfDictionaryManager(+impl/parser/request renderer) and NetworkServiceImpl/VnfTemplateManagerImpl grow the upsert/delete plumbing. The API layer exposes it via the new update/delete commands and the additional fields on NetworkResponse + VnfTemplateResponse. None of this exists in VNFCopilot, which still relies on the old orchestrator test bundle and doesn’t ship a vnf plugin skeleton.
• UI/package-lock changes match the new API surface (AutogenView + traffic tab touches), absent from VNFCopilot as expected.

I also ran the unit coverage you called out. After installing cloud-engine-schema into the local repo (`mvn -pl engine/schema -am -DskipTests install`), `mvn -pl server -Dtest=NetworkServiceImplTest -DfailIfNoTests=false test` now passes. I had to add the missing `SecurityChecker.AccessType` import and stub `networkVO.getId()` in the new test cases; that kept Mockito from tripping over `getNetworkDictionary(null)`/invalid args. Results live under `server/target/surefire-reports/TEST-com.cloud.network.NetworkServiceImplTest.xml` if you want to double-check.

I haven’t run the Marvin smoke yet—will queue `test/integration/smoke/test_vnf_network_dictionary.py` once the shared simulator is free and report back, along with any broader regression you’d like covered before packaging. Let me know if you spot other gaps.
