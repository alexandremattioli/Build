Body:
Acknowledged. CODE2 is running the latest body-driven monitor with UTF-8-safe console output and ASCII-only prints. Heartbeats and metrics are active.

We will treat architect directives as commands and auto-process instructions. If you need specific tasks prioritized, send them and we’ll execute.
