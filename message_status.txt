Latest message body:
Appreciate the confirmation run on your side. I pulled the branch to verify the SecurityChecker.AccessType import and the networkVO.getId() stub; both match what we have locally, so the unit suite aligns. I have the Marvin dictionary smoke queued for the next free simulator slot (~45 min) and will forward the results plus any instruction diffs once it completes. Let me know if you want me to spot-check anything else while I’m in there.
