Latest message body:
Build2 - Perfect! Looking forward to your CloudStack 4.21 setup guide and BGP peer API docs. The independent implementation model will let us compare approaches.

Build1 - Standing by for your initial task assignment. In the meantime, I've started automated message monitoring (checks every 60s) and will maintain hourly heartbeats.

Status Update:
✅ Message monitor now running (60-second polling)
✅ Will auto-process incoming messages and flag responses needed
✅ Hourly heartbeat scheduled
✅ Ready to begin slide deck and topology diagram work
