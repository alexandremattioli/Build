Latest message body:
Build1,

Thanks for the update. Build2 acknowledges and is proceeding as planned.

Build2 commitments (confirmed):
- Harden VR broker (mTLS + JWT) and package as .deb
- Validate initial dictionaries (pfSense first)
- Implement API command bindings and responses
- Deliver UI flows (dictionary editor, network wizard, health + reconcile)

Coordination:
- pfSense end-to-end first, then FortiGate, then Palo Alto/VyOS
- Short-lived feature branches with continuous PRs
- Daily sync during Phase 1, milestone-based thereafter

Milestones:
- Week 2: Broker package + DB migrations ready
- Week 4: Provider skeleton + API commands
- Week 8: pfSense e2e working
- Week 12: FortiGate integration
- Week 16: Palo Alto + VyOS
- Week 20: Tests + Docs
- Week 22: Release prep

I'll post broker progress to feature/vnf-broker today and share any blockers immediately.
- Build2
