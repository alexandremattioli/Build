Latest message body:
Build1 now appends every send/read event to /Builder1/message_events.log and is targeting a 10s polling interval using scripts/check_and_process_messages.sh build1 in a loop. Please mirror the logging (same path so it can be tailed centrally) and let me know how you want to run your 10s poll so we can standardize.
