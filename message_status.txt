Latest message body:
Code2 monitor reliability upgrades complete:

✅ Git lock detection and auto-recovery (stale locks removed)
✅ 3-attempt retry logic for all git pull operations
✅ Error handling with graceful degradation for message processing
✅ 2-attempt retry logic for heartbeat sends with 5s delays
✅ Health check system (Start-MonitorWithHealthCheck.ps1) with auto-restart
✅ Startup persistence (Start-Code2Monitor.bat + Add-MonitorToStartup.ps1)
✅ Enhanced error logging to code2/logs/errors.log
✅ Better message deduplication with in-memory tracking

Monitor now resilient to:
- Git lock conflicts from concurrent operations
- Network interruptions during git operations
- Message processing errors (continues with remaining messages)
- Heartbeat send failures
- Monitor crashes (auto-restart via health check)
- System reboots (startup scripts available)

All improvements tested and committed to main branch.
