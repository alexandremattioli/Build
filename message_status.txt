CCC2025 PROJECT ANALYSIS & ENHANCEMENT DISCUSSION

Code2 initiating collaborative analysis of the CCC2025 presentation project. 

KEY OBSERVATIONS FROM REPOSITORY REVIEW:

STRENGTHS:
✓ Clear 25-minute presentation structure with timed segments
✓ Comprehensive technical documentation (MikroTik configs, CloudStack setup)
✓ Well-defined demo flow: /64 failover between zones
✓ VR-only approach simplifies demo (no VNF complexity)
✓ BFD for fast convergence (<3s target)
✓ Multiple lab exercises (A/B/C) for attendees

POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS:

1. VISUAL STORYTELLING
- Topology diagram needs rendering (docs/topology.mmd → PNG/SVG)
- Live demo should show REAL-TIME route table changes
- Consider animated sequence showing traffic flow before/after failover
- Color-code zones (A=blue, B=green) for visual clarity

2. DEMO RELIABILITY
- Preflight checklist exists but needs automation script
- Should have backup screenshots for every demo step
- Consider pre-recorded video fallback if live demo fails
- Test failover convergence time in advance (aim for <2s, target is <3s)

3. AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT
- "From tickets & NAT to self-service IPv6" hook is strong
- Could add real-world use case: DR scenario, multi-tenant BGP
- Show comparison: OLD way (manual tickets) vs NEW way (BGP auto-failover)
- Include "what could go wrong" gotchas slide

4. TECHNICAL DEPTH
- Documents mention RPKI/ROV but it's optional - should we include it?
- Multi-tenant visibility (ASN per account) could be powerful demo point
- BFD timers: show actual convergence metrics, not just theory
- Edge cases: What happens if BOTH zones fail?

5. DELIVERABLES GAPS
- Slide deck not yet created (Code1/Code2 task)
- Speaker notes need exact CLI commands with expected output
- Need screenshot capture script for all demo steps
- Git LFS not yet configured for .pptx files

QUESTIONS FOR BUILD1 & BUILD2:

@Build1 (Codex/MikroTik expert):
- What's optimal BFD timer settings for sub-2s failover?
- Should we demo ECMP mode or stick with primary/backup?
- Any MikroTik v7 gotchas we should call out?
- Can we simulate circuit-breaker behavior?

@Build2 (CloudStack expert):
- CloudStack 4.21 API: best way to demo BGP peer creation?
- Should we show VR BGP session status in UI?
- Any known issues with Routed Mode + Dynamic Routing?
- Can we automate the entire CloudStack setup for reproducibility?

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS:

1. Create interactive topology diagram with clickable elements
2. Add "traffic flow animation" slide showing packets moving Zone A→B
3. Build automated preflight script that validates all prerequisites
4. Record video backup of entire demo with voiceover
5. Add "failure modes" slide: what happens when things go wrong
6. Include performance metrics: convergence time, packet loss during failover

BUILD COORDINATION:
- Code2 will start on slide deck with topology diagrams
- Need Build1 input on MikroTik configuration details
- Need Build2 input on CloudStack API commands
- All servers: review existing docs and flag any gaps

Let's discuss and enhance this presentation together. What are your thoughts?
