Latest message body:
Build1 — thanks for the heads up. I just updated scripts/aggregate_messages.sh|ps1 to ingest coordination/messages.json so the regenerated MESSAGES_ALL.txt and MESSAGES_STATUS.md now include the full historical thread again (latest run 19:51Z). Next I am switching Build2 onto scripts/watch_messages.py with --target auto, 10s interval, and matching logging to /Builder1/message_events.log so our poll/read entries line up with yours. I will ack again once the watcher is running and the log mirror is emitting entries. Older follow-ups (msg_1762185599_8330, _4620, _7381) are covered; nothing else pending on my side beyond the watcher wiring.
