PROJECT COORDINATION: CCC2025 - CloudStack IPv6 + BGP Presentation

Code2 coordinating work distribution for CCC 2025 presentation development.

PROJECT DETAILS:
- Title: Building Complex Scalable Networks in CloudStack — The Power of IPv6 + BGP
- Presenter: Alexandre Mattioli (ShapeBlue)
- Session: 25 minutes at CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2025
- Repo: https://github.com/alexandremattioli/CCC2025

TECHNICAL SCOPE:
- Stock CloudStack 4.21 with Routed Mode + Dynamic Routing (BGP)
- VR-only demo (no VNFs) for IPv6 /64 prefix failover between zones
- 3× MikroTik routers: Core (AS 64500), Edge-A (AS 64510), Edge-B (AS 64520)
- IPv6 /48 split: /56 per zone (A & B), /64 per network
- Live demo: Traffic failover Zone A → Zone B with BFD fast convergence

WORK DISTRIBUTION (Independent Implementation Model):

BUILD1 (Codex):
- Lab environment setup documentation
- MikroTik v7 router configuration commands (Core/Edge-A/Edge-B)
- BGP policy knobs documentation (local-pref, MED, AS-path prepend)
- BFD configuration and failover timing analysis

BUILD2 (Copilot):
- CloudStack 4.21 setup guide (Routed Mode + Dynamic Routing)
- API command sequences for BGP peer configuration
- VR deployment and verification procedures
- Integration test scripts

BUILD3:
- Live demo runbook (25-min timeline with exact steps)
- Preflight checklist (addresses, ASNs, BGP sessions, test VMs)
- Troubleshooting guide for common BGP issues
- Backup/fallback procedures

BUILD4:
- Lab exercises documentation (Labs A/B/C)
- Screenshot capture procedures
- Demo VM setup (HTTP banners, zone identification)
- Network topology diagrams

CODE1/CODE2 (Windows):
- PowerPoint slide deck development
- Presentation flow and speaker notes
- Topology diagram rendering (Mermaid → PNG/SVG)
- Git LFS setup for binary files (.pptx)

DELIVERABLES NEEDED:
1. Slide deck with topology diagrams
2. Live demo runbook with exact CLI commands
3. MikroTik v7 configuration snippets
4. CloudStack setup guide (UI + API)
5. Three lab exercises (failover, brownout, RPKI)
6. Preflight checklist
7. Speaker notes (25-min timeline)

COORDINATION PROTOCOL:
- Each server implements their section INDEPENDENTLY
- Review each other's work for improvements
- Share findings and best practices
- Merge best approaches from multiple implementations
- No division of labor on implementation (full redundancy)

TIMELINE:
- Initial drafts: ASAP
- Review cycle: ongoing
- Final rehearsal: before conference
- Target: production-ready demo with <3s failover time

REPOSITORY STRUCTURE:
CCC2025/
├── docs/ (runbooks, guides, commands)
├── lab/ (exercises A/B/C)
├── slides/ (PowerPoint with Git LFS)
└── README.md (quick start)

All servers: Review https://github.com/alexandremattioli/CCC2025 and begin work on assigned sections. Use Build coordination messaging for questions and progress updates.

CODE2 available for Windows-specific tasks, PowerShell automation, and cross-server coordination.
