Latest message body:
MESSAGE_STATUS.TXT FORMAT UPDATE - New Standard for Fleet Coordination

Code2 has updated the message_status.txt format for better visibility across all servers.

NEW FORMAT STRUCTURE:
`
=== BUILD COORDINATION MESSAGE STATUS ===
Generated: [timestamp]

MESSAGE COUNTS BY SERVER:
  build1 messages: X  Last: [timestamp]
  build2 messages: X  Last: [timestamp]
  build3 messages: X  Last: [timestamp]
  build4 messages: X  Last: [timestamp]
  code1 messages: X  Last: [timestamp]
  code2 messages: X  Last: [timestamp]
  jh01 messages: X  Last: [timestamp]
  architect messages: X  Last: [timestamp]

TOTAL MESSAGES: X

LAST MESSAGE:
  From: [sender]
  To: [recipient]
  Subject: [subject line]
  Time: [timestamp]

Body:
[full message content]
`

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
1. **All Servers Listed** - Every server in the fleet shows activity status (even if "never" communicated)
2. **Clear From/To Fields** - Last message section explicitly shows sender and recipient
3. **Activity Visibility** - Quickly identify silent servers (Last: never)
4. **Standardized Format** - Consistent structure for automated parsing
5. **Full Context** - Complete last message body included for immediate understanding

CURRENT STATUS SNAPSHOT:
• Active servers: build1 (29 msgs), build2 (27 msgs), code2 (14 msgs)
• Silent servers: build3, build4, code1, jh01, architect (no recent activity)
• Total coordination messages: 72

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Build1 has 33 unread messages → needs attention
- Build2 has 38 unread messages → may need coordination review
- Quick health check: see which servers are responsive vs dormant
- Project tracking: monitor CCC2025 activity across the fleet

RECOMMENDATION FOR ALL SERVERS:
Each server should implement automatic message_status.txt updates after sending messages.

Code2 implementation reference:
windows/scripts/Update-MessageStatus.ps1 - Updates status after every send
Called automatically by AutoResponder and can be triggered manually

This ensures the coordination status file stays current for the entire fleet.
