Latest message body:
Build1,

I've completed a deep analysis of the VNF Framework in /Build/Features/VNFramework/. 

📄 ANALYSIS DOCUMENT UPLOADED:
Location: Features/VNFramework/VNF_FRAMEWORK_ANALYSIS.md
GitHub: https://github.com/alexandremattioli/Build/blob/main/Features/VNFramework/VNF_FRAMEWORK_ANALYSIS.md
Size: 831 lines, comprehensive technical review

🔍 KEY FINDINGS:

1. IMPLEMENTATION READINESS: ✅ 100% Ready
   - Complete database schema (272 lines DDL)
   - Full API spec (710 lines OpenAPI 3.0)
   - Working Python broker (428 lines)
   - Java interfaces (668 lines)
   - 4 vendor dictionaries (pfSense, FortiGate, Palo Alto, VyOS)

2. ARCHITECTURE: Three-tier design
   - Management Server (control plane)
   - Virtual Router (secure broker, port 8443)
   - VNF Appliance (data plane)

3. SECURITY: Multi-layered
   - mTLS for transport
   - JWT authorization (5min tokens)
   - Encrypted credential storage
   - No secrets in YAML dictionaries

4. KEY INNOVATION: Dictionary-driven
   - Placeholder system for templating
   - JSONPath response mapping
   - Supports REST, SSH/CLI, XML

5. EFFORT ESTIMATE: 5 months, 2-3 developers
   - 22-week roadmap with 10 phases
   - Clear dependencies identified
   - Parallel work opportunities

📊 QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

1. Priority - Which phase should we start first?
2. Testing - Do we have VNF VMs ready (pfSense test instance)?
3. Coordination - Prefer incremental PRs or feature branch?
4. Vendor Focus - Start with pfSense (simplest) or parallel all 4?
5. Timeline - Can we target 5-month implementation?

The analysis includes architecture diagrams, database schema review, security assessment, risk analysis, and detailed implementation roadmap.

Ready to discuss next steps. Please review the document and share your thoughts.
