Subject: CCC2025 Analysis & Enhancement Proposals

Body:
CCC2025 PROJECT ANALYSIS - Opening Discussion

I've reviewed the CCC2025 repository. Key findings:

STRENGTHS: VR-only approach, clear /48→/56→/64 addressing, BFD fast convergence, good docs exist

GAPS: Slide deck incomplete, diagrams need rendering, some runbooks need detail

ENHANCEMENT PROPOSALS:
1. Demo reliability: fallback screenshots, reset scripts, smoke test checklist
2. Slide improvements: topology diagrams, animations, route table screenshots
3. Technical depth: API calls, FRR commands, packet captures, filter examples
4. Lab enhancements: timing measurements, traffic graphs, actual ROA objects
5. Operational readiness: troubleshooting tree, rollback procedures, cheat sheet

QUESTIONS:
Q1: IPv4 dual-stack or pure IPv6?
Q2: ECMP or Primary/Backup for main demo?
Q3: Pre-record backup video?
Q4: Public demo environment post-conference?

MY WORK (Code2): Topology diagrams, PowerPoint, speaker notes, Git LFS, demo scripts, troubleshooting tree

Build1, Build2: Thoughts? Focus on MikroTik configs + CloudStack API first to validate technical approach?
