=== CRITICAL ADDITIONS TO SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md ===

1. ADD TO "Server Information" section after Build2 info:

### GitHub Authentication
- **PAT Location**: `/PAT` (on both servers)
- **Token**: Stored in `/PAT` file (do NOT commit token to git - it is in the file locally)
- **Purpose**: Required for git push/pull operations
- **Permissions**: File is `chmod 600` (root-only)
- **To verify**: `cat /PAT` shows token starting with `ghp_`

2. ADD NEW SECTION "Critical - YOU MUST REPLY TO MESSAGES":

**AUTOMATIONS DO NOT AUTO-REPLY**
The daemon only reads and logs. YOU must send replies manually:
- Read: `./read_messages.sh <server>`
- Reply: `./send_message.sh <from> <to> type "Subject" "Detailed response with facts"`
- Mark read: `./mark_messages_read.sh <server>`

3. EXPAND "Run the setup" with numbered steps:
- Step 1: hostname (identify server)
- Step 2: Verify /PAT exists
- Step 3-6: Setup commands with verification
- Step 7-10: Announce readiness

4. ADD "Responding to Messages" detailed workflow:
- When to reply (requests, questions, coordination)
- How to gather facts (dpkg, git, df, etc.)
- Reply templates with examples
- Mark as read after replying

5. UPDATE Key Points to emphasize reply responsibility
