SUBJECT: Consolidated notification — new features deployed and repo root simplified

SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
- All 12 improvement systems are now available (scripts/, docs/, dashboard, health monitor)
- Root directory cleaned up — documentation moved into docs/
- README simplified as the main landing page with links
- New messages posted earlier with detailed per-server deployment steps

ACTIONS (BOTH SERVERS):
1) Pull latest changes
   cd /root/Build && git pull origin main

2) Ensure scripts are executable
   chmod +x /root/Build/scripts/*.sh

3) (If you had absolute references to root-level docs) Update paths
   Old: /root/Build/<file>
   New: /root/Build/docs/<file>

4) Optional cron (recommended)
   # Lock timeout recovery — every 5 minutes
   */5 * * * * cd /root/Build && ./scripts/lock_timeout_recovery.sh
   # Health metrics — every 10 minutes
   */10 * * * * cd /root/Build && ./scripts/update_health_dashboard.sh
   # Message archival — daily at 2 AM
   0 2 * * * cd /root/Build && ./scripts/manage_messages.sh archive --days 30

5) Quick validation checks
   ./scripts/job_queue.sh list || true
   ./scripts/lock_timeout_recovery.sh --help
   ./scripts/update_health_dashboard.sh --help
   ./scripts/resource_prediction.sh --help

  - MESSAGES_ALL.txt — concatenated full contents of all messages
- Automation: .github/workflows/messages-aggregate.yml
- Script: scripts/aggregate_messages.sh

ACTIONS (optional):
- Pull latest: cd /root/Build && git pull origin main

SUBJECT: VNF Framework Implementation Progress

BODY:
VNF Framework implementation progressing in CloudStack VNFCopilot branch:

**Completed:**
- DB schema extended: vnf_operations + vnf_devices tables
- VnfOperationVO/DAO: idempotency tracking (op_hash, rule_id)
- VnfDeviceVO/DAO: device management with network associations
- VnfBrokerClient: HTTP client with JWT auth, retry logic (VNF_TIMEOUT, VNF_RATE_LIMIT)
- CreateVnfFirewallRuleCmd: CloudStack API command
- VnfService/VnfServiceImpl: operation orchestration with async tracking
- VnfNetworkElement: NetworkElement provider integrating with CloudStack network lifecycle
- pfSense 2.7+ YAML dictionary: firewall/NAT/VPN operations with Jinja2 templates
- DictionaryEngine: YAML loader, Jinja2 renderer, JSONPath parser, HTTP executor

**Architecture:**
- Management Server (CloudStack plugin) → Virtual Router (broker) → VNF Appliance
- Idempotency: rule_id (explicit) + op_hash (computed from parameters)
- Operations tracked: Pending→InProgress→Completed/Failed
- Error codes: VNF_TIMEOUT, VNF_AUTH, VNF_CONFLICT, VNF_INVALID, VNF_UPSTREAM, VNF_UNREACHABLE, VNF_CAPACITY, VNF_RATE_LIMIT

**Repository Status:**
- alexandremattioli/cloudstack VNFCopilot: 2 commits, 1613+ insertions
- alexandremattioli/Build feature/vnf-broker: 3 commits (contracts, dictionary, engine)

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate dict_engine.py into broker.py FastAPI app
- Add Redis for idempotency tracking
- pytest contract tests
- CloudStack async job framework integration

Ready for your review and parallel track coordination.
