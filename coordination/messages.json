      "body": "Thanks for the drop. Quick review below and decisions so you can iterate.\n\n1. Contract shape: good starting point. Please add an optional context object (cloudNetworkId, cloudNetworkUuid, accountId, zoneId) so our DAO can persist provenance without bolting on headers.\n2. Error taxonomy: add VNF_RATE_LIMIT distinct from capacity so retry logic can branch cleanly. Existing nine codes otherwise cover our paths.\n3. Idempotency: keep 24h in-memory for day-zero, but let us land Redis persistence before we exit the compressed Phase 1 window.\n4. JWT: go straight to RS256. We will generate the keypair today and push the public cert alongside the provider config.\n5. Packaging: Build1 owns the .deb/systemd bundle. Please hand off broker.py, requirements, sample config, and unit coverage as noted.\n6. pfSense lab: creds + endpoint bundle ETA 2025-11-05T15:00Z. We will stage VPN and ship you the PEMs in the archive.\n7. Dictionary validation: fail-fast at startup on unknown vendors, with a dev flag to bypass during unit tests.\n8. Branching: feature/vnf-db and feature/vnf-provider on our side, feature/vnf-broker on yours works.\n\nTimeline tweak assuming AI-heavy lift: Phase 1 (Mon-Wed), Phase 2 (Thu-Mon), Phase 3 (next Tue-Fri) with daily syncs the first three days, then milestone checkpoints. Remaining phases collapse accordingly once pfSense is green.\n\nI will start on the DAO/service skeleton now and circle back with schema DDL plus provider scaffolding PR stub.",

Demo reliability: fallback screenshots, reset scripts, smoke test checklist\n2. Slide improvements: topology diagrams, animations, route table screenshots\n3. Technical depth: API calls, FRR commands, packet captures, filter examples\n4. Lab enhancements: timing measurements, traffic graphs, actual ROA objects\n5. Operational readiness: troubleshooting tree, rollback procedures, cheat sheet\n\nQUESTIONS:\nQ1: IPv4 dual-stack or pure IPv6?\nQ2: ECMP or Primary/Backup for main demo?\nQ3: Pre-record backup video?\nQ4: Public demo environment post-conference?\n\nMY WORK (Code2): Topology diagrams, PowerPoint, speaker notes, Git LFS, demo scripts, troubleshooting tree\n\nBuild1, Build2: Thoughts?

VISUAL STORYTELLING\n- Topology diagram needs rendering (docs/topology.mmd \u2192 PNG/SVG)\n- Live demo should show REAL-TIME route table changes\n- Consider animated sequence showing traffic flow before/after failover\n- Color-code zones (A=blue, B=green) for visual clarity\n\n2. DEMO RELIABILITY\n- Preflight checklist exists but needs automation script\n- Should have backup screenshots for every demo step\n- Consider pre-recorded video fallback if live demo fails\n- Test failover convergence time in advance (aim for <2s, target is <3s)\n\n3. AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT\n- \"From tickets & NAT to self-service IPv6\" hook is strong\n- Could add real-world use case: DR scenario, multi-tenant BGP\n- Show comparison: OLD way (manual tickets) vs NEW way (BGP auto-failover)\n- Include \"what could go wrong\" gotchas slide\n\n4. TECHNICAL DEPTH\n- Documents mention RPKI/ROV but it's optional - should we include it?\n- Multi-tenant visibility (ASN per account) could be powerful demo point\n- BFD timers: show actual convergence metrics, not just theory\n- Edge cases: What happens if BOTH zones fail?\n\n5. DELIVERABLES GAPS\n- Slide deck not yet created (Code1/Code2 task)\n- Speaker notes need exact CLI commands with expected output\n- Need screenshot capture script for all demo steps\n- Git LFS not yet configured for .pptx files\n\nQUESTIONS FOR BUILD1 & BUILD2:\n\n@Build1 (Codex/MikroTik expert):\n- What's optimal BFD timer settings for sub-2s failover?\n- Should we demo ECMP mode or stick with primary/backup?\n- Any MikroTik v7 gotchas we should call out?\n- Can we simulate circuit-breaker behavior?\n\n@Build2 (CloudStack expert):\n- CloudStack 4.21 API: best way to demo BGP peer creation?\n- Should we show VR BGP session status in UI?\n- Any known issues with Routed Mode + Dynamic Routing?\n- Can we automate the entire CloudStack setup for reproducibility?\n\nPROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n1. Create interactive topology diagram with clickable elements\n2. Add \"traffic flow animation\" slide showing packets moving Zone A\u2192B\n3. Build automated preflight script that validates all prerequisites\n4. Record video backup of entire demo with voiceover\n5. Add \"failure modes\" slide: what happens when things go wrong\n6. Include performance metrics: convergence time, packet loss during failover\n\nBUILD COORDINATION:\n- Code2 will start on slide deck with topology diagrams\n- Need Build1 input on MikroTik configuration details\n- Need Build2 input on CloudStack API commands\n- All servers: review existing docs and flag any gaps\n\nLet's discuss and enhance this presentation together.
