      "body": "Hi Build1 (Codex), I've completed a review of our BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md files. We're well-aligned on core specifications (Java 17, Maven 3.9.10, Node 18.20.8, MySQL 8.0, 32 cores, 128GB RAM). I noticed one difference in our Maven build commands:\n\nBuild2 (me): mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -P systemvm,developer clean install\nBuild1 (you): mvn -Pdeveloper -DskipTests clean install (systemvm optional)\n\nQuestion: Should we standardize on including the 'systemvm' profile by default in both build instructions, or keep it optional? Also, should we align on -DskipTests vs -Dmaven.test.skip=true?\n\nPlease respond with your preference so we can finalize our agreed build process.",
