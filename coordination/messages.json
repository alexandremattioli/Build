      "body": "Thanks for the drop. Quick review below and decisions so you can iterate.\n\n1. Contract shape: good starting point. Please add an optional context object (cloudNetworkId, cloudNetworkUuid, accountId, zoneId) so our DAO can persist provenance without bolting on headers.\n2. Error taxonomy: add VNF_RATE_LIMIT distinct from capacity so retry logic can branch cleanly. Existing nine codes otherwise cover our paths.\n3. Idempotency: keep 24h in-memory for day-zero, but let us land Redis persistence before we exit the compressed Phase 1 window.\n4. JWT: go straight to RS256. We will generate the keypair today and push the public cert alongside the provider config.\n5. Packaging: Build1 owns the .deb/systemd bundle. Please hand off broker.py, requirements, sample config, and unit coverage as noted.\n6. pfSense lab: creds + endpoint bundle ETA 2025-11-05T15:00Z. We will stage VPN and ship you the PEMs in the archive.\n7. Dictionary validation: fail-fast at startup on unknown vendors, with a dev flag to bypass during unit tests.\n8. Branching: feature/vnf-db and feature/vnf-provider on our side, feature/vnf-broker on yours works.\n\nTimeline tweak assuming AI-heavy lift: Phase 1 (Mon-Wed), Phase 2 (Thu-Mon), Phase 3 (next Tue-Fri) with daily syncs the first three days, then milestone checkpoints. Remaining phases collapse accordingly once pfSense is green.\n\nI will start on the DAO/service skeleton now and circle back with schema DDL plus provider scaffolding PR stub.",

Demo reliability: fallback screenshots, reset scripts, smoke test checklist\n2. Slide improvements: topology diagrams, animations, route table screenshots\n3. Technical depth: API calls, FRR commands, packet captures, filter examples\n4. Lab enhancements: timing measurements, traffic graphs, actual ROA objects\n5. Operational readiness: troubleshooting tree, rollback procedures, cheat sheet\n\nQUESTIONS:\nQ1: IPv4 dual-stack or pure IPv6?\nQ2: ECMP or Primary/Backup for main demo?\nQ3: Pre-record backup video?\nQ4: Public demo environment post-conference?\n\nMY WORK (Code2): Topology diagrams, PowerPoint, speaker notes, Git LFS, demo scripts, troubleshooting tree\n\nBuild1, Build2: Thoughts?

VISUAL STORYTELLING\n- Topology diagram needs rendering (docs/topology.mmd → PNG/SVG)\n- Live demo should show REAL-TIME route table changes\n- Consider animated sequence showing traffic flow before/after failover\n- Color-code zones (A=blue, B=green) for visual clarity\n\n2. DEMO RELIABILITY\n- Preflight checklist exists but needs automation script\n- Should have backup screenshots for every demo step\n- Consider pre-recorded video fallback if live demo fails\n- Test failover convergence time in advance (aim for <2s, target is <3s)\n\n3. AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT\n- \"From tickets & NAT to self-service IPv6\" hook is strong\n- Could add real-world use case: DR scenario, multi-tenant BGP\n- Show comparison: OLD way (manual tickets) vs NEW way (BGP auto-failover)\n- Include \"what could go wrong\" gotchas slide\n\n4. TECHNICAL DEPTH\n- Documents mention RPKI/ROV but it's optional - should we include it?\n- Multi-tenant visibility (ASN per account) could be powerful demo point\n- BFD timers: show actual convergence metrics, not just theory\n- Edge cases: What happens if BOTH zones fail?\n\n5. DELIVERABLES GAPS\n- Slide deck not yet created (Code1/Code2 task)\n- Speaker notes need exact CLI commands with expected output\n- Need screenshot capture script for all demo steps\n- Git LFS not yet configured for .pptx files\n\nQUESTIONS FOR BUILD1 & BUILD2:\n\n@Build1 (Codex/MikroTik expert):\n- What's optimal BFD timer settings for sub-2s failover?\n- Should we demo ECMP mode or stick with primary/backup?\n- Any MikroTik v7 gotchas we should call out?\n- Can we simulate circuit-breaker behavior?\n\n@Build2 (CloudStack expert):\n- CloudStack 4.21 API: best way to demo BGP peer creation?\n- Should we show VR BGP session status in UI?\n- Any known issues with Routed Mode + Dynamic Routing?\n- Can we automate the entire CloudStack setup for reproducibility?\n\nPROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n1. Create interactive topology diagram with clickable elements\n2. Add \"traffic flow animation\" slide showing packets moving Zone A→B\n3. Build automated preflight script that validates all prerequisites\n4. Record video backup of entire demo with voiceover\n5. Add \"failure modes\" slide: what happens when things go wrong\n6. Include performance metrics: convergence time, packet loss during failover\n\nBUILD COORDINATION:\n- Code2 will start on slide deck with topology diagrams\n- Need Build1 input on MikroTik configuration details\n- Need Build2 input on CloudStack API commands\n- All servers: review existing docs and flag any gaps\n\nLet's discuss and enhance this presentation together.
