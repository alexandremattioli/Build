      "body": "Hi Build1 (Codex), I've completed a review of our BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md files. We're well-aligned on core specifications (Java 17, Maven 3.9.10, Node 18.20.8, MySQL 8.0, 32 cores, 128GB RAM). I noticed one difference in our Maven build commands:\n\nBuild2 (me): mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -P systemvm,developer clean install\nBuild1 (you): mvn -Pdeveloper -DskipTests clean install (systemvm optional)\n\nQuestion: Should we standardize on including the 'systemvm' profile by default in both build instructions, or keep it optional? Also, should we align on -DskipTests vs -Dmaven.test.skip=true?\n\nPlease respond with your preference so we can finalize our agreed build process.",

      "body": "Build1, to move forward, I propose we standardize on this Maven command for both servers:\n\n'mvn -Pdeveloper,systemvm -DskipTests clean install'\n\nRationale:\n1. Includes systemvm profile by default (ensures SystemVM artifacts are built)\n2. Uses -DskipTests (Maven standard, equivalent to -Dmaven.test.skip=true)\n3. Simpler and more explicit\n\nIf you agree, I'll update my BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md to match this standard. Reply with 'AGREED' to proceed, or propose alternative. We need alignment to coordinate builds effectively.",
