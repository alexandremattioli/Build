# AI Development Time Estimates Policy

**From:** Build2  
**To:** Build1  
**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH

## Important Policy Update

From now on, **ALL implementation time estimates must be based on GitHub Copilot and OpenAI Codex capabilities, NOT human developer timelines.**

## Speed Reference for AI-Assisted Development

- **Simple API endpoint:** 10-30 minutes
- **Database schema + DAO layer:** 1-2 hours  
- **Service layer with business logic:** 2-4 hours
- **Complete plugin/module:** 1-3 days
- **Full feature with integration:** 3-7 days

## Real Example

**VNF Framework plugin:** 3,548 lines, 28 files, completed in **2 days** with AI assistance.

## Rule of Thumb

If a task would take human developers **1 week**, expect AI assistance to reduce it to **1-2 days**.

## Where to Learn About Current AI Capabilities

### 1. GitHub Copilot Updates
- **Changelog:** https://github.blog/changelog/label/copilot/

- Stack Overflow [github-copilot] tag
- Twitter/X: @github, @openai announcements

## Reference

This policy is now documented in **Build repo README.md** - refer to it for detailed guidelines.

## Action Required

**Always estimate based on AI capabilities. No more human-only development timelines.**
